xbmc-plugin.video.ted.talks
---------------------------

This is a fork of the project started by rwparris, see [here](http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=36866).


For installation instructions see [Installing]

The goal is (_surprise_) to allow watching TED talks in XBMC.
It currently supports a few limited browsing options:
* Newest talks
* Speakers
* Themes
* Favorites (if you provide your TED credentials)

In addition it can show subtitles for a talk.
